This installation sets up a pmwiki farm, which allows you to run
multiple pmwikis using a single installation of the pmwiki
software. This setup is different from the typical pmwiki farm setup
in that it allows you to have the field accessed from a completely
separate directory path than the farm itself, and field directories
don't have to be siblings of each other. This will allow the field to
be in, for example, /var/www/vhosts/example.com/wiki directory, while
the farm and the field data will be another non-server accessible
path, such as /var/farm.

INSTALLATION
============

Getting the wiki farm:

    git clone git://github.com/tamouse/pmwikifields.git /path/to/farm

Obtain the latest version of pmwiki from:

    http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/pmwiki-latest.tgz

Save the .tgz file into a safe space, and unpack it:

    cd /path/to/farm
    tar zxvf /path/to/pmwiki-latest.tgz

PmWiki will be unpacked into a directory such as pmwiki-2.2.34/
(depending on the version number of the current pmwiki software).
Link to this in the farm:

    ln -s pmwiki-2.2.xx pmwiki-latest

Create links in the farm directory to directories in pmwiki-latest:

    ln -s pmwiki-latest/scripts .
    ln -s pmwiki-latest/wikilib.d .

Copy the pmwiki-latest/pub directory to the farm directory:

    cp -r pmwiki-latest/pub .

Next, run the install.sh in the new installation:

    ./install.sh

This will modify the wikifield index.php file and the farm newwiki.sh
file to point to the proper place for the farm.

CONFIGURATION
============

To make farm-wide configurations, you will need a configuration file
in the farm's local directory. A sample configuration file is in
/path/to/farm/docs/sample-site-config.php which you should copy to
/path/to/farm/local/config.php and modify as needed.

(Note: refrain from making site-wide configurations as much as
possible to allow fields to configure things as needed.)
