This installation sets up a pmwiki farm, which allows you to run
multiple pmwikis using a single installation of the pmwiki
software. This setup is different from the typical pmwiki farm setup
in that it allows you to have the field accessed from a completely
separate directory path than the farm itself, and field directories
don't have to be siblings of each other. This will allow the field to
be in, for example, /var/www/vhosts/example.com/wiki directory, while
the farm and the field data will be another non-server accessible
path, such as /var/farm.

In the steps below, the farm is assumed to be in /var/farm, and the
field in /var/www/vhosts/example.com/wiki. Adjust accordingly.

INSTALLATION
============

Getting the wiki farm:

    git clone git://github.com/tamouse/pmwikifields.git /var/farm

This will install a read-only version of the farm. If you want to
collaborate on the farm project, install a version into a clean
directory where you can work on the code without actually installing
and creating a farm.

Obtain the latest version of pmwiki from:

    http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/pmwiki-latest.tgz

Save the .tgz file into a safe space, and unpack it:

    cd /path/where/you/saved/pmwiki
    tar zxvf pmwiki-latest.tgz

PmWiki will be unpacked into a directory such as pmwiki-2.2.34/
(depending on the version number of the current pmwiki software). Copy
this into the farm directory:

    cp -r pmwiki-2.2.34/* /var/farm/pmwiki

Next, run the install.sh in the new installation:

    cd /var/farm/
    ./install.sh

This will modify and create all the necessary parts that will be
needed to run a farm.

CREATING A NEW FIELD
====================

To create a new wiki field, run the newwiki.sh script and respond to
the prompts to customize your new wiki.

    cd /var/farm
    ./newwiki.sh

This script will build the field from the contents of the
/var/farm/skel directory, modifying the contents as needed to make it
fit the new wiki you wish to create. If you follow the prompts
accurately, your new field will be set up as follows:

  * new field data in /var/farm/var/field
  * new field web site in /var/www/vhosts/example.com/wiki

The field data directory contains the following:

   cookbook/ - for storing recipes exclusive to this field
   docs/ - contains sample files to create configurations for this
           field
   local/ - where per-field configuration files exist
   pub/ - a symlink to the wikifarm pub/ directory
   wiki.d/ - where the wiki's pages are stored
   uploads/ - where the wiki's attachments are stored

The field web site contains two files:

   index.php - a symlink to /var/farm/skel/index.php, which should
               have been modified so $FarmD is set to the right path.
   .htaccess - contains the apache directives to make the farm work
               correctly, including rewrite directives to make clean
               urls work.

Note that if you want to have other files accessible to the server,
you can add them to the field web site as you see fit.
