!!!Updating the package
Just copy the unpacked files over your existing userauth2 files. Your 
permission setup will be left untouched. Only the help file needs 
manually moved to [@wikilib.d/@] as described above.

!!!Resetting the permission setup
For resetting the permission setup, remove the dirs [@userperms/@], 
[@groupperms/@], [@ipranges/@] with their content. Consider deleting
[@profiles/@], where passwords are saved (unless otherwise configured).
